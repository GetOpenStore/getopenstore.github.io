# About

**Overt** is an open app store. Anyone can distribute apps for anyone else to find and install.

For developers, this means **no feature restrictions**, **no revenue cuts**, and **no arduous review process**.  
If it's not outright malware, it's fair game.

For users, this means **all your apps** are available **in one place**. No more installers or "dmg" files.

## How it works

Overt is a graphical user interface (GUI) that unifies various package managers. _Package managers_ are command-line programs that manage software "packages", which are often applications.

Most package managers work by monitoring a list of _source repositories_, each of which can provide packages to install.  
For example, the source repository `apps` at `https://example.com/apps` might provide the packages `chrome`, `firefox`, and so on.

In most cases, Overt simply talks with package managers to:

1. Find out what packages are available
2. Install/update/uninstall packages at your request
3. Add/remove source repositories at your request

Overt currently supports [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS. Support is planned for [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) and [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) on Windows.
