# Marketing

## Badge

You can use the following badge to advertise your software's presence on Overt. Most users are familiar with these (e.g., [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/)).

If possible, please link to this image instead of redistributing it, so you can receive any artwork updates automatically.

## Quick-install links

Users can install your software via Overt by clicking a link on your website or project page.

"Web-based" links prompt users to install Overt first, when necessary. Add yours to the badge image above, if possible.

Use the following tool to generate a quick-install link for your software.

import LinkGenerator from "../../../components/LinkGenerator";

<LinkGenerator client:idle />
