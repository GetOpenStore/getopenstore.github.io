# Distribution

Want to distribute your software on Overt? Great! Simply package it using a supported package manager.

For macOS:

- [Homebrew Cask](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook) (for apps)
- [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) (for open-source command-line tools & libraries)

For Windows:

- Winget (support planned)
- Scoop (support planned)

Once you've packaged your software, either try to contribute it to the package manager's default source repository, or host it on your own source repository:

- For Homebrew:
  - [Contribute](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request#cask-related-pull-request) if your software is deemed acceptable ([acceptable casks](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Casks) / [acceptable formulae](https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae))
  - Otherwise, [create a tap](https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap)

Please see [Marketing](/developers/marketing) to advertise your Overt presence with a badge and a quick-install link.
