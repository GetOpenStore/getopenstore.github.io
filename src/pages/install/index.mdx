# Install

You will have to use Terminal, but only once.

1. **Install <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank">Homebrew <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right ms-1" role="img" aria-label="External link"></i> &nbsp;</a>**
   if you haven't yet.
2. Run the following Terminal commands:

   ```sh
   brew tap homebrew/cask
   brew install getovert/tap/overt
   open -a Overt
   ```

3. **Done!** Overt is now running and in your Applications folder.

4. **(Optional)** Some "pkg" installers require elevated permissions. Normally, Overt asks for your password for these.

   If you'd like to use Touch ID instead, install <a href="https://github.com/artginzburg/sudo-touchid" target="_blank">sudo-touchid</a> via Overt:

   1. <a
        href="/open?action=overt:brew%3F1=add-source-repository%261[name]=artginzburg/homebrew-tap%261[url]=https://github.com/artginzburg/homebrew-tap%262=install%262[name]=sudo-touchid"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Click here to open the Overt app.
      </a>
   2. When asked to add "artginzburg/homebrew-tap" as a source, click <span class="bg-primary rounded-pill text-white fs-6">&nbsp; CONTINUE &nbsp;</span>.
   3. When asked to install sudo-touchid, click <span class="bg-primary rounded-pill text-white fs-6">&nbsp; CONTINUE &nbsp;</span>.
   4. Since Overt can't start background services yet, run the following Terminal commands:

      ```sh
      brew tap homebrew/services
      sudo brew services start sudo-touchid
      ```

<Card header="Future directions &ndash; Automating this process">
An installation method that avoids the use of Terminal would be ideal.

One idea is to have users download Overt in a `zip` file initially, and have it
auto-detect the absence of Homebrew and offer to install it, using a flow similar to
package installation. For users to get updates, Overt would also have to request
permission to add its own source repository, install itself via the package manager,
and then nuke the running version from the Downloads folder (or wherever).

Another idea is to have users download a separate "Install Overt" app that guides users
through the process of installing the package manager, adding the source repository,
and installing the real Overt package. This approach has some notable downsides, though:

- The installer app would have to be maintained separately, and would probably end up
  less robust than Overt itself at adding the source repository and installing the package
- Users would have to redownload the installer if they ever needed to repair their installation

If you have any feedback on this process, please reach out!
