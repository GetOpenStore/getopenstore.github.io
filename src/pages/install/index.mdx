# Install

## Get the app

### Direct download

import { GitHubReleaseAssets } from "../../components/GitHubReleaseAssets";

<GitHubReleaseAssets client:load />

### From Homebrew

If you already have Homebrew installed, it's as simple as:

```sh
brew install overt
```

Overt is now in your Applications folder! Launch it with:

```sh
open -a Overt
```

## Enable Touch ID **(Optional)**

Some .pkg installers require elevated permissions. Normally, Overt asks for your password for these.

If you'd like to use Touch ID instead, use <a href="https://github.com/artginzburg/sudo-touchid" target="_blank">sudo-touchid</a>:

1. <a href="/open?action=overt:brew%3F1=add-source-repository%261[name]=artginzburg/homebrew-tap%261[url]=https://github.com/artginzburg/homebrew-tap%262=install%262[name]=sudo-touchid" target="_blank">Click here to install sudo-touchid from Overt.</a>
   1. <span class="text-muted">When asked to add "artginzburg/homebrew-tap" as a source, click <span class="fs-6 bg-success text-white rounded p-1">CONTINUE</span>.</span>
   2. <span class="text-muted">When asked to install "sudo-touchid", click <span class="fs-6 bg-success text-white rounded p-1">CONTINUE</span>.</span>
2. Since Overt can't start background services yet, run the following Terminal commands:

   ```sh
   brew tap homebrew/services
   sudo brew services start sudo-touchid
   ```
